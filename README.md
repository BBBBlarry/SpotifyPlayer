# SpotifyPlayer
A Smart Spotify player that makes playing songs on Spotify easier than ever.

This application understands the voice commands using Microsoft Speech API and the brain of Microsoft LUIS to paraphrase the voice commands as per the Aritst, Song, Playlist and Album. After understanding which song to play, it goes ahead and uses the Spotify Web API to search for the url of that specific song and loads it up on the web browser. 

Say commands like :

"Play the song everglow by Coldplay from the album a head full of dreams"
